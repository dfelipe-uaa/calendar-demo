# How to use on GitHub Pages (quick):

Copy over the mock files in the `/docs` folder

In repo Settings → Pages, choose the branch (e.g., main) and root (or /docs if you place these files there).

Wait for the site to build; your Pages URL will appear in the Pages settings.

You can freely edit course names, dates, costs, and descriptions—main page stays short, subpages hold the full info.
